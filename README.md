A citation picker and lightweight reference manager for
[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/). Uses a BibTeX File and supports various
formats like [Pandoc Markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citation-syntax),
[Multi-Markdown](https://fletcher.github.io/MultiMarkdown-6/syntax/citation.html),
[LaTeX](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Biblatex_citation_styles), or [Org
Mode](https://orgmode.org/manual/Citations.html).

## Feature Overview

### Base Features
- Inserts __Pandoc Citation Syntax__ (`[@citekey]`), supporting page numbers &
  multiple citations (`[@citekey, p. 23; @citekey, p. 42]`). Can also be
  configured to use __LaTeX__, __Multi-Markdown__, __eta templates__, __Org
  Mode__, `[[wikilinks]]`, `#tags`, or `bare citkeys` as citation format.
- __App-independent:__ Works system-wide, in every text field of every app.
- __Smart Search:__ Search for citekeys, authors, title, publication, keywords
  (tags), include or exclude authors in *et al.*, tab-completion,
  fuzzy-matching, sorting recently used entries to the top.
- __Simple Installation:__ Just enter the path to your `.bib` file, and you are
  ready to go.
- __Blazingly Fast:__ Considerably quicker than any other citation picker (~200
  ms to fully reload a library with ~4000 entries).

### Advanced Features
- __Various Citation Actions:__ Paste single-entry bibliographies, open URLs,
  open or create literature notes, attach PDFs, search for `.csl` files online,
  and more.
- __Lightweight Reference Manager:__ Automatically rename and file PDFs, add or
  remove entries, and more.
- __Quickly Add New Entries:__ Select a DOI or ISBN and add them directly to
  your BibTeX library via hotkey.
- __Obsidian Integration:__ When located in your [Obsidian
  Vault](https://obsidian.md/), literature notes are automatically opened or
  created in Obsidian instead of the default markdown app.

## Installation
1. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/alfred-bibtex-citation-picker/releases/latest).
2. Enter the BibTeX Library path.
3. Use the citation picker via the Alfred keyword `ct`, or set a
   [hotkey](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/triggers/hotkey/) for the
   citation picker by double-clicking the respective field in the workflow
   window.

## Basic Usage
Press the [hotkey](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/triggers/hotkey/) in
any text field to start the citation picker. Alternatively, use the `ct`
keyword.

### Search
- You can search for the title, author/editor (last name), year, collection, or
  journal name.
- Prepend `@` to a word to search for a citekey, for example `@Grieser2020`.
- Prepend `#` to search for keywords (tags), for example `#sociology`.
- *Smart Queries*: You can search for any combination of the above. For example,
  the query `2020 #cognition grieser` searches for entries published in 2020,
  with the tag "cognition," and with "Grieser" as author/editor.
- *Short Queries*: You do not need to fully spell out every item. `grie #cogn
  2020` gives you the same result as above, if no other author begins with
  `grie` and no other tag starts with `cogn`.

### Citation Actions
- <kbd>‚èé</kbd>: Paste the citekey of the selected citation.
- <kbd>‚å•</kbd><kbd>‚èé</kbd>: Add another citation.
- <kbd>‚áß</kbd><kbd>‚åò</kbd><kbd>‚èé</kbd>: Paste an inline-citation (citation
  without surrounding formatting, for example `@Grieser2022` instead of `[@Grieser2022]`)
- <kbd>‚åò</kbd><kbd>‚èé</kbd>: Add page numbers before pasting the selected citekey.
  * Confirm the page number with <kbd>‚å•</kbd><kbd>‚èé</kbd> or
	<kbd>‚åò</kbd><kbd>‚èé</kbd> to add another citation afterward.
  * Confirm with <kbd>‚áß</kbd><kbd>‚åò</kbd><kbd>‚èé</kbd> for an inline-citation
	with page number (`@Grieser2022 [p. 42]`).

### URL Actions
- <kbd>‚åÉ</kbd><kbd>‚èé</kbd>: Open the URL in the browser.
- <kbd>‚åò</kbd><kbd>C</kbd>: Copy the URL to the clipboard.
- In both cases, if the entry has a DOI but not a URL, the citation picker uses
  the DOI-URL (`https://doi.org/‚Ä¶`) instead.

### Icon Meanings

| Icon | Entry has       |
|:-----|:----------------|
| üåê   | URL or DOI      |
| üìÑ   | Abstract        |
| n üè∑ | n Keywords      |
| üìì   | Literature Note |
| üìï   | PDF             |

## Changing the Citation Format

### Available Formats
You can use the `scp` and select __Change Citation Format__ to change the format
of the citations:

- Pandoc (default)
- Org Mode
- Multi-Markdown (MMD)
- LaTeX
- eta template
- iA Writer
- `[[wikilink]]`
- `#tag`
- bare citekey
- bracketed citekey

> [!NOTE]  
> Not all formats support all citation-related features. For example, adding
> Page numbers as well as inline-citations are not supported for Latex,
> Wikilinks, and Tags.

### Other Format Customizations
If you want to use a format that is not available, you can customize the format
yourself by changing the workflow environment variables starting with `_format`.
(Tutorial: [How to set environment variables in
Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/advanced/variables/#environment))

If there is a citation syntax that is commonly used, or if you want to improve
support for an existing format, feel free to open a [Feature
Request](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/alfred-bibtex-citation-picker/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.yml&title=Feature+Request%3A+).

You can also make a PR to [this file which defines the citation formats](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/alfred-bibtex-citation-picker/blob/main/scripts/toggle-citation-format.js).

## Advanced Usage

### Bibliography Actions
- <kbd>‚áß</kbd><kbd>‚èé</kbd>: Reveal the entry in Zotero, neovim, BibDesk, VS
  Code, or Sublime Text, depending on the setting in the workflow configuration.
- <kbd>‚åò</kbd><kbd>‚å•</kbd><kbd>‚èé</kbd>: Paste the full bibliographic entry in
  the APA 6th Style (requires [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html)).
- <kbd>‚åò</kbd><kbd>L</kbd>: Preview the (unabridged) title, abstract, and list
  of keywords.
- <kbd>‚åò</kbd><kbd>fn</kbd><kbd>‚èé</kbd>: Delete the entry from the BibTeX
  library. (‚ö†Ô∏è This cannot be undone.)

### Add New Entries
- [Universal Action](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/features/universal-actions/)
  or [Hotkey](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/triggers/hotkey/): Uses
  the selected __DOI__, __ISBN__, or __URL containing a DOI__ to add a new entry
  to the library.
  * A second [Universal
	Action](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/features/universal-actions/) can be
	used to parse & add a bibliographic entry. Requires
	[anystyle](https://github.com/inukshuk/anystyle).
  * The new entry is added to your library, with a correctly formatted and
	unique citekey. Afterward, the entry is opened.
- [File Action](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/features/universal-actions/): Use
  the `Add Entry and Auto-file` action on a PDF file that includes a DOI. The
  DOI is automatically retrieved from the PDF, the entry added to the library,
  and the PDF auto-filed (see [PDF Management
  Actions](#pdf-management-actions)). Requires [pdfgrep](https://pdfgrep.org/).

> [!NOTE]
> Adding or removing entries does __not__ work with the [BetterBibTeX Zotero
> Plugin](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) since the plugin only does
> a one-way-sync (Zotero ‚ûû BibTeX file), meaning any changes to the `.bib` file
> are not reflected in Zotero.

### Literature Note Actions
- The citation picker looks in the folder specified in the workflow settings for
  files that are *exactly* named like the citekey, optionally followed by an
  underscore `_` and some text, for example: `{citekey}.md` or
  `{citekey}_{title}.md`. The citekey itself must not contain underscores, and
  the filename must not include the `@`.
- Entries that have such a literature note is indicated by a `üìì`.
- <kbd>‚åÉ</kbd><kbd>‚å•</kdb><kbd>‚èé</kbd>: Open the literature note.
  * If the file is in your [Obsidian Vault](https://obsidian.md/), it is opened
	directly in Obsidian instead of the default text editor.
  * If there is no literature note, a new one is created.
- <kbd>‚åò</kbd><kbd>Y</kbd>: Preview the literature note with `QuickLook`
  (requires `QLmarkdown` or `Peek`[^1]).
- Add `*` to any search query to filter only for entries with literature notes,
  for example `* grieser` searches for entries matching "Grieser" which also
  have a literature notes. Can be combined with other queries (see: [smart
  queries](#search)).

### PDF Management Actions
The following features require that all your PDFs are located in the folder
specified in your workflow settings.
- The `üìï` indicates that the entry already has an associated PDF at that location.
- <kbd>‚á™</kbd><kbd>‚èé</kbd>[^2]: If the entry has an associated PDF file, open it
  with the default PDF reader. The citekey must not contain an underscore (`_`).
  If the PDF folder setting is left empty, tries to open a PDF file listed under
  the `file` key in the BibTeX file.
- Add `pdf` to any search query to filter only for entries with PDFs that have
  been added by the auto-file feature. `pdf grieser`, for example, displays only
  entries from the author "Grieser" with PDFs. Can be combined with other
  queries (see: [smart queries](#search)).

### Auxiliary Features
Triggered via the Alfred Keyword `scp` (mnemonic: `S`upercharged `C`itation `P`icker).
- __Cheatsheet__: Open a cheat sheet of the available actions of the
  Supercharged Citation Picker.
- __Citation Style Search__: Search for a citation style (`.csl` file), which is
  downloaded to the location specified in your workflow settings (default:
  `~/.pandoc/csl/`).
- __Force Buffer Reload__: Force a reload of the citation picker. Mostly for
  debugging purposes.
