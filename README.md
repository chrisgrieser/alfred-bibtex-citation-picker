[Multi-Markdown](https://fletcher.github.io/MultiMarkdown-6/syntax/citation.html),
[LaTeX](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Biblatex_citation_styles), [org
mode](https://orgmode.org/manual/Citations.html), and various other formats.

## Feature overview

### Core features
- Inserts __Pandoc citation syntax__ (`[@citekey]`), supporting page numbers &
  multiple citations (`[@citekey, p. 23; @citekey, p. 42]`). Can also be
  configured to use __LaTeX__, __Multi-Markdown__, __eta templates__, __org
  mode__, `[[wikilinks]]`, `#tags`, or `bare citkeys` as citation format.
- __App-independent:__ Works system-wide, in every text field of every app.
- __Smart search:__ Search for citekeys, authors, title, publication, keywords
  (tags), include or exclude authors in *et al.*, tab-completion,
  short queries, sorting recently used entries to the top, ‚Ä¶
- __Simple installation:__ Just enter the path to your `.bib` file, and you are
  ready to go.
- __Blazingly fast:__ Considerably quicker than any other citation picker
  (200 ms to fully reload a library with 4000 entries).

### Advanced features
- __Citation actions:__ Paste single-entry bibliographies, open URLs,
  open or create literature notes, attach PDFs, search for `.csl` files online,
  and more.
- __Lightweight reference management:__ Automatically rename and file PDFs, add,
  or remove entries.
- __Quickly add new entries:__ Select a DOI or ISBN and add them directly to
  your BibTeX library via hotkey.
- __Support for two libraries:__ You can pick citations from two BibTeX Library
  files at the same time.
- __Obsidian integration:__ When located in your [Obsidian
  Vault](https://obsidian.md/), literature notes are automatically
  opened/created in Obsidian instead of the default Markdown app.

## Installation
1. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/alfred-bibtex-citation-picker/releases/latest).
2. Enter the BibTeX library path.
3. Select your citation format. The default is *Pandoc Citations*. To switch to
   another format like LaTeX, Multi-Markdown, org mode, eta, \[\[wikilinks\]\],
   or #tags use the keyword `scp` in Alfred and select `Change citation format`.
4. Use the citation picker via the Alfred keyword `cc`, or set a
   [hotkey](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/triggers/hotkey/) for the
   citation picker by double-clicking the respective field in the workflow
   window.

## Basic usage
Press the [hotkey](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/triggers/hotkey/) in
any text field to start the citation picker. Alternatively, use the `ct`
keyword.

### Search
- You can search for the title, author/editor (last name), year, collection, or
  journal name.
- Prepend `@` to a word to search for a citekey, for example `@Grieser2020`.
- Prepend `#` to search for keywords (tags), for example `#sociology`.
- *Smart Queries*: You can search for any combination of the above. For example,
  the query `2020 #cognition grieser` searches for entries published in 2020,
  with the tag "cognition," and with "Grieser" as author/editor.
- *Short Queries*: You do not need to fully spell out every item. `grie #cogn
  2020` gives you the same result as above, if no other author begins with
  `grie` and no other tag starts with `cogn`.

### Citation actions
- <kbd>‚èé</kbd>: Paste the citekey of the selected citation.
- <kbd>‚å•</kbd><kbd>‚èé</kbd>: Add another citation.
- <kbd>‚áß</kbd><kbd>‚åò</kbd><kbd>‚èé</kbd>: Paste an inline-citation (citation
  without surrounding formatting, for example `@Grieser2022` instead of `[@Grieser2022]`)
- <kbd>‚åò</kbd><kbd>‚èé</kbd>: Add page numbers before pasting the selected citekey.
  * Confirm the page number with <kbd>‚å•</kbd><kbd>‚èé</kbd> or
	<kbd>‚åò</kbd><kbd>‚èé</kbd> to add another citation afterward.
  * Confirm with <kbd>‚áß</kbd><kbd>‚åò</kbd><kbd>‚èé</kbd> for an inline-citation
	with page number (`@Grieser2022 [p. 42]`).

### URL actions
- <kbd>‚åÉ</kbd><kbd>‚èé</kbd>: Open the URL in the browser.
- <kbd>‚åò</kbd><kbd>C</kbd>: Copy the URL to the clipboard.
- In both cases, if the entry has a DOI but not a URL, the citation picker uses
  the DOI-URL (`https://doi.org/‚Ä¶`) instead.

### Icon meanings

| Icon | Entry has                             |
|:-----|:--------------------------------------|
| üåê   | URL or DOI                            |
| üìÑ   | Abstract                              |
| n üè∑ | n Keywords                            |
| üìì   | Literature Note                       |
| üìï   | PDF                                   |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£    | entry is from 2nd library             |
| üìé   | entry has attachment                  |

## Changing the citation format
You can use the `scp` and select __Change citation format__ to change the format
of the citations:
- Pandoc (default)
- Org Mode
- Multi-Markdown (`MMD`)
- LaTeX
- eta template
- iA Writer
- Formatted single entry
	* Requires [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html).
	* The used citation style can be customized in the workflow configuration
	  (default: APA 7th).
- `[[wikilink]]`
- `#tag`
- bare citekey
- bracketed citekey

> [!NOTE]
> Not all formats support all citation-related features. For example, adding
> Page numbers as well as inline-citations are not supported for Latex,
> Wikilinks, and Tags.

If there is a citation syntax that is commonly used, or if you want to improve
support for an existing format, feel free to open a [Feature
Request](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/alfred-bibtex-citation-picker/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.yml&title=Feature+Request%3A+)
or make a PR to [this file which defines the citation
formats](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/alfred-bibtex-citation-picker/blob/main/scripts/toggle-citation-format.js).

> [!NOTE]
> Due to technical restrictions, you may need to set the citation style once
> more after updates to this workflow.

## Advanced usage

### Bibliography actions
- <kbd>‚áß</kbd><kbd>‚èé</kbd>: Reveal the entry in Zotero, Neovim, VS Code,
  BibDesk, or Sublime Text, depending on the setting in the workflow
  configuration. (Note that this does not work for the secondary library.)
- <kbd>‚åò</kbd><kbd>‚å•</kbd><kbd>‚èé</kbd>: Paste the full bibliographic entry.
	* Requires [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html).
	* The used citation style can be customized in the workflow configuration.
	  (default: APA 7th)
- <kbd>‚åò</kbd><kbd>L</kbd>: Preview the unabridged title, abstract, and list of
  all keywords (tags).
- <kbd>‚åò</kbd><kbd>fn</kbd><kbd>‚èé</kbd>: Delete the entry from the BibTeX
  library. (‚ö†Ô∏è This cannot be undone.)
- <kbd>‚åò</kbd><kbd>Y</kbd>: Preview the URL of entry in a QuickLook window.

### Add new entries
- [Universal Action](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/features/universal-actions/)
  or [Hotkey](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/triggers/hotkey/): Uses
  the selected __DOI__, __ISBN__, or __URL containing a DOI__ to add a new entry
  to the library.

> [!NOTE]
> Adding or removing entries does __not__ work with the [BetterBibTeX Zotero
> Plugin](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) since the plugin only does
> a one-way-sync (Zotero ‚ûû BibTeX file), meaning any changes to the `.bib` file
> are not reflected in Zotero.

### Literature note actions
- The citation picker looks in the folder specified in the workflow settings for
  files that are *exactly* named like the citekey. Entries that have such a
  literature note are indicated by a `üìì`.
- <kbd>‚åÉ</kbd><kbd>‚å•</kbd><kbd>‚èé</kbd>: Open the literature note.
  * If the file is in your [Obsidian Vault](https://obsidian.md/), it is
	opened directly in Obsidian instead of the default text editor.
  * If there is no literature note, a new one is created.
- Add `*` to any search query to filter only for entries with literature notes,
  for example `* grieser` searches for entries matching "Grieser" which also
	have a literature notes. Can be combined with other queries (see: [smart
	queries](#search)).

### PDF management actions
The following features require that all your PDFs are located in the folder
specified in your workflow settings.
- The citation picker looks in the folder specified in the workflow settings for
  PDFs that are *exactly* named like the citekey, optionally followed by an
  underscore `_` and some text. For example: `{citekey}.pdf` or
  `{citekey}_{title}.pdf`. The citekey itself must not contain underscores, and
  the filename must not include the `@`.
- The `üìï` indicates that the entry has an associated PDF at that location.
- <kbd>Hyper</kbd><kbd>‚èé</kbd>[^1]: If the entry has an associated PDF file,
  open it with the default PDF reader.
- Add `pdf` to any search query to filter only for entries with PDFs that have
  been added by the auto-file feature. `pdf grieser`, for example, displays only
  entries from the author "Grieser" with PDFs. Can be combined with other
  queries (see: [smart queries](#search)).
- A `üìé` indicates that the BibTeX entry has a `file` or `attachment` field. You
  can use <kbd>‚åÉ</kbd><kbd>‚å•</kbd><kbd>‚åò</kbd><kbd>‚èé</kbd> to open the
  attachment. If there are multiple attachments, the first one is opened.

### Link preview
- Install the
  [AlfredExtraPane](https://github.com/mr-pennyworth/alfred-extra-pane) for
  previews of entry URLs.

### Auxiliary features
Triggered via the Alfred Keyword `scp` (mnemonic: Supercharged Citation Picker).
- __Cheatsheet__: Open a cheat sheet of the available actions of the
  Supercharged Citation Picker.
- __Citation Style Search__: Search for a citation style (`.csl` file), which is
  downloaded to the location specified in your workflow settings (default:
  `~/.pandoc/csl/`).
- __Force Buffer Reload__: Force a reload of the citation picker. Mostly for
  debugging purposes.
