A citation picker and lightweight reference manager for [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/). Uses a BibTeX File and supports various formats like [Pandoc Markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citation-syntax), [Multi-Markdown](https://fletcher.github.io/MultiMarkdown-6/syntax/citation.html), [LaTeX](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Biblatex_citation_styles), or [Org Mode](https://orgmode.org/manual/Citations.html).

## Feature Overview
- Inserts __Pandoc Citation Syntax__ (`[@citekey]`), supporting page numbers & multiple citations (`[@citekey, p. 23; @citekey, p. 42]`). Can also be configured to use __LaTeX__, __Multi-Markdown__, __eta templates__, __Org Mode__, `[[wikilinks]]`, `#tags` or `bare citkeys` as citation format.
- __App-independent:__ Works system-wide, in every text field of every app.
- __Smart Search:__ Search for citekeys, authors, title, publication, keywords (tags), include or exclude authors in *et al.*, tab-completion, fuzzy-matching, sorting recently used entries to the top.
- __Feature-rich:__ Paste single-entry bibliographies, open URLs, open or create literature notes, attach PDFs, search for `.csl` files online, and more.
- __Blazingly Fast:__ Considerably quicker than any other citation picker (~200 ms to fully reload a library with ~4000 entries).
- __Simple Installation:__ Just enter the path to your `.bib` file, and you are ready to go.
- __Lightweight Reference Manager:__ Automatically rename and file PDFs, remove, entries, and more.
- __Quickly Add New Entries:__ Select a DOI or ISBN and add them directly to your BibTeX library via hotkey.
- __Obsidian Integration:__ When located in your [Obsidian Vault](https://obsidian.md/), literature notes are automatically opened or created in Obsidian instead of the default markdown app.

## Installation
1. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/alfred-bibtex-citation-picker/releases/latest).
2. Enter the BibTeX Library path.
3. Use the citation picker via the Alfred keyword `ct`, or set a [hotkey](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/triggers/hotkey/) for the citation picker by double-clicking the respective field in the workflow window.

## Basic Usage
Press the [hotkey](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/triggers/hotkey/) in any text field to start the citation picker. Alternatively, use the `ct` keyword.

### Search
- You can search for the title, author/editor (last name), year, collection, or journal name.
- Prepend `@` to a word to search for a citekey, for example `@Grieser2020`.
- Prepend `#` to search for keywords (tags), for example `#sociology`.
- *Smart Queries*: You can search for any combination of the above. For example, the query `2020 #cognition grieser` searches for entries published in 2020, with the tag "cognition," and with "Grieser" as author/editor.

### Citation Actions
- <kbd>‚èé</kbd>: Paste the citekey of the selected citation.
- <kbd>‚å•</kbd><kbd>‚èé</kbd>: Add another citation.
- <kbd>‚áß</kbd><kbd>‚åò</kbd><kbd>‚èé</kbd>: Paste an inline-citation (citation without surrounding formatting, for example `@Grieser2022` instead of `[@Grieser2022]`)
- <kbd>‚åò</kbd><kbd>‚èé</kbd>: Add page numbers before pasting the selected citekey.
  - Confirm the page number with <kbd>‚å•</kbd><kbd>‚èé</kbd> or <kbd>‚åò</kbd><kbd>‚èé</kbd> to add another citation afterward.
  - Confirm with <kbd>‚áß</kbd><kbd>‚åò</kbd><kbd>‚èé</kbd> for an inline-citation with page number (`@Grieser2022 [p. 42]`).

### URL Actions
- <kbd>‚åÉ</kbd><kbd>‚èé</kbd>: Open the URL in the browser.
- <kbd>‚åò</kbd><kbd>C</kbd>: Copy the URL to the clipboard.
- In both cases, if the entry has a DOI but not a URL, the citation picker uses the DOI-URL (`https://doi.org/‚Ä¶`) instead.

### Icon Meanings

| Icon | Entry has       |
|:-----|:----------------|
| üåê   | URL or DOI      |
| üìÑ   | Abstract        |
| n üè∑ | n Keywords      |
| üìì   | Literature Note |
| üìï   | PDF             |

## Changing the Citation Format

### Available Formats
You can use the `scp` and select __Change Citation Format__ to change the format of the citations:

- Pandoc (default)
- Org Mode
- Multi-Markdown (MMD)
- LaTeX
- eta template
- iA Writer
- `[[wikilink]]`
- `#tag`
- bare citekey
- bracketed citekey

> __Note__  
> Not all formats support all citation-related features. For example, adding Page numbers as well as inline-citations are not supported for Latex, Wikilinks, and Tags, and iA Writer does not support multiple citations.

### Other Format Customizations
If you want to use a format that is not available, you can customize the format yourself by changing the workflow environment variables starting with `_format`. (Tutorial: [How to set environment variables in Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/advanced/variables/#environment))

If there is a citation syntax that is commonly used, or if you want to improve support for an existing format, feel free to open a [Feature Request](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/alfred-bibtex-citation-picker/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.yml&title=Feature+Request%3A+).

You can also make a PR to [this file which defines the citation formats](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/alfred-bibtex-citation-picker/blob/main/scripts/toggle-citation-format.js).

## Advanced Usage

### Bibliography Actions
- <kbd>‚áß</kbd><kbd>‚èé</kbd>: Reveal the entry in Zotero, neovim, BibDesk, VS Code, or Sublime Text, depending on the setting in the workflow configuration.
- <kbd>‚åò</kbd><kbd>‚å•</kbd><kbd>‚èé</kbd>: Paste the full bibliographic entry in the APA 6th Style (requires [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html)).
- <kbd>‚åò</kbd><kbd>L</kbd>: Preview the (unabridged) title, abstract, and list of keywords.
- <kbd>‚åò</kbd><kbd>fn</kbd><kbd>‚èé</kbd>: Delete the entry from the BibTeX library. (‚ö†Ô∏è This cannot be undone.) 

### Add New Entries
- [Universal Action](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/features/universal-actions/) or [Hotkey](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/triggers/hotkey/): Uses the selected __DOI__, __ISBN__, or __URL containing a DOI__ to add a new entry to the library.
  - A second [Universal Action](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/features/universal-actions/) can be used to parse & add a bibliographic entry. Requires [anystyle](https://github.com/inukshuk/anystyle).
  - The new entry is added to your library, with a correctly formatted and unique citekey. Afterward, the entry is opened.
- [File Action](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/features/universal-actions/): Use the `Add Entry and Auto-file` action on a PDF file that includes a DOI. The DOI is automatically retrieved from the PDF, the entry added to the library, and the PDF auto-filed (see [PDF Management Actions](#pdf-management-actions)). Requires [pdfgrep](https://pdfgrep.org/).

> __Warn__
> Adding or removing entries does __not__ work with the [BetterBibTeX Zotero Plugin](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) since the plugin only does a one-way-sync (Zotero ‚ûû BibTeX file), meaning any changes to the `.bib` file are not reflected in Zotero.

### Literature Note Actions
- The citation picker looks in the folder specified in the workflow settings for files that are *exactly* named like the citekey, optionally followed by an underscore `_` and some text, for example: `{citekey}.md` or `{citekey}_{title}.md`. The citekey itself must not contain underscores, and the filename must not include the `@`.
- Entries that have such a literature note is indicated by a `üìì`.
- <kdb>‚åÉ</kdb><kdb>‚å•</kdb><kdb>‚èé</kdb>: Open the literature note.
  - If the file is in your [Obsidian Vault](https://obsidian.md/), it is opened directly in Obsidian instead of the default text editor.
  - If there is no literature note, a new one is created.
- <kdb>‚åò</kdb><kdb>Y</kdb>: Preview the literature note with `QuickLook` (requires `QLmarkdown` or `Peek`[^1]).
- Add `*` to any search query to filter only for entries with literature notes, for example `* grieser` searches for entries matching "grieser" which also have a literature notes. Can be combined with other queries (see: [smart queries](#search)).

### PDF Management Actions
The following features require that all your PDFs are located in the folder specified in your workflow settings.
<!-- LTeX: enabled=false -->
- <kbd>fn</kbd><kbd>‚èé</kbd>: __Auto-file and auto-rename__ the *currently selected PDF*. Inside your selected PDF folder, uses the template path: `{first_letter_of_citekey}/{citekey-author-part}/{citekey}_{shortened_title}.pdf` <!-- LTeX: enabled=true -->
- The `üìï` indicates that the entry already has an associated PDF at that location.
- <kbd>‚á™</kbd><kbd>‚èé</kbd>[^2]: If the entry has an associated PDF file, open it with the default PDF reader. The citekey must not contain an underscore (`_`).
- Add `pdf` to any search query to filter only for entries with PDFs that have been added by the auto-file feature. `pdf grieser`, for example, displays only entries from the author "Grieser" with PDFs. Can be combined with other queries (see: [smart queries](#search)).

### Auxiliary Features
<!-- vale Vale.Spelling = NO -->
Triggered via the Alfred Keyword `scp` (mnemonic: `S`upercharged `C`itation `P`icker).
<!-- vale Vale.Spelling = YES -->
- __Cheatsheet: Citation Picker Actions__: Open a cheat sheet of the available actions of the Supercharged Citation Picker.
- __Citation Style Search__: Search for a citation style (`.csl` file), which is downloaded to the location specified in your workflow settings (default: `~/.pandoc/csl/`).
- __Force Buffer Reload__: Force a reload of the citation picker. Mostly for debugging purposes.

<!-- vale Google.FirstPerson = NO -->
## Spread the Word
As this is probably the most feature-rich and most performant citation picker on macOS, it is kind of a bummer that not many people know about this. However, I do not really know where to "advertise" this, since I am not aware of any forum or website for academics that work with markdown and BibTeX. So if you know a good place, feel free to contact me or spread the word yourself. üòä

## About the Developer
In my day job, I am a sociologist studying the social mechanisms underlying the digital economy. For my PhD project, I investigate the governance of the app economy and how software ecosystems manage the tension between innovation and compatibility.

[^1]: [QLmarkdown](https://github.com/sbarex/QLMarkdown) and [Peek](https://apps.apple.com/app/peek-quick-look-extension/id1554235898) both enable previewing of Markdown documents. Peek works with a wide range of other file types than Markdown, but costs around 5‚Ç¨. `QLMarkdown` is free, but only works for Markdown and requires some minor setup. To enable the proper display of YAML headers, you need to enable the respective setting in the Advanced Options of `QLMarkdown` or Peek.
